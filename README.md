## 1 · Course Description

This class focuses on **front-end user-interface engineering** with an emphasis on utility, accessibility, and personalized user experiences. Using HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript tools (including **React** and a glimpse of **Flutter**), I’ll design responsive layouts, craft interactive elements, and tune performance.  
The goal: build interfaces that adapt to user behavior, preferences, and context—delivering a unique, engaging experience for every visitor.
