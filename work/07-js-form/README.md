# Assignment - JS Form

**Due: Thu Oct 24, 11:59pm PT** 

## Submission Instructions

* start from the up-to-date main branch (`git checkout main; git pull origin main`)
* Create a feature branch named 'js-form' (`git checkout -b js-form`)
* add the necessary files to have the required features
* add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to main
* Be sure to include the TA(s) and myself reviewer(s)

## Goal

Build an `index.html` page in `public/` that contains a form that is validated by JS
- The validation messages will appear in certain situations and be cleared in response to certain steps
- The form will show a layout in 1 column format for a "mobile" size
- The form will show a layout in 2 column format for a "desktop" size
  - Remember that 1-column/2-column for form layout refers to labels and fields, NOT the total number of columns in a row!
- Your error message text should be set by `innerText` or `innerHTML`
  - Replacing form fields gets complicated because it will lose the data in that field, it will lose any cursor position in that field - I recommend NOT replacing form fields just yet.  Replace any validation message text instead

The code is usable by:
- Running `npm install` **in this directory** 
  - Only needs to run **in this directory** once per computer
- Running `npm start` **in this directory**
  - Visiting http://localhost:3000/

## Form Details

- The page will have a visually distinct header and footer
- The page will contain a registration form that will submit to "/register" using POST
- The form will collect these fields
  - Name
  - Email
  - Confirm Email
  - A checkbox with name attribute of "wants-spam"
    - Label of your choice
  - A select menu with name attribute of "tier"
    - Label and options and values of your choice
- Each form field will have label text that meaningfully identifies the field being collected
- The fields will have the following validations
  - Name is required
  - Email is required
    - There is no validating the content of the email for this assignment!
  - Confirm Email must match the Email
- The validations must NOT be done with HTML validations
  - This is to confirm your understanding of JS validation, not because HTML validation is good or bad
  - No "required" attributes
  - No "pattern" attributes
  - No `type="email"` 
    - Use `type="text"` (the default for input elements) instead
- All "required" fields will be indicated to the user as required before they fill the form out
  - This is separate and in addition to the validation message.  This is the same as the "\* Required" (or similar) that we had previously.
- Any field validation failures will be shown by extra text in addition to any required indication
  - Color alone is not sufficient to indicate an error, but color should be used
- All failed validations will be indicated to the user when the validations fail as described below
  - The Name field will inform the user they need to fill out the field if they have not
    - This validation will occur when the "input" event occurs on the field OR the user attempts to submit the form (meaning you have listeners for both events)
    - This error message will not be shown if this error is fixed (the field is provided)
  - The Email field will inform the user they need to fill out the field if they have not
    - This validation will occur when the user goes to submit the form
    - This error message will be removed if this error is fixed (the field has characters) and the user attempts to submit
  - The Confirm Email field will inform the user the field needs to match Email if it does not
    - This validation will occur when the user goes to submit the form
    - This error message will be removed if this error is fixed (the field matches) and the user attempts to submit
  - All fields are validated when the form is submitted
    - If a validation is failed the form will not submit

## Accessibility Requirements
- The form can be navigated and used with keyboard (using tab, typing, and space) or mouse
- Required fields are labeled as such in a way that do not require color-sightedness
  - This means you CAN use color and/or bolding, but should not ONLY use color/bolding.  You want something that a screen reader or other assistive technology would notice
  - Errors are indicated with additional text that do not require color-sightedness to read
- The page will have an adaptive breakpoint at 40rem
  - Above this breakpoint the form will use a 2 column layout
  - Below this breakpoint the form will use a 1 column layout
    - Remember that 1-column/2-column for form layout refers to labels and fields, not the total number of columns in a row!
  - The column requirements do not apply to checkboxes - use whatever formatting looks good
- The page should have a reasonable layout for a range of widths, from 360px to 1000px (with normal text-size)

## Additional Requirements
- All CSS class names should be semantic kebab-case or BEM style (or a mix of the two)
- Do not use var
- Use let and const as described in class
- Load your JS as described in class
- Use meaningful and helpful variable names as described in class
- Use consistent indentation and helpful whitespace to make your JS, HTML, and CSS easy to read
- Use semicolons appropriately 
- Add event listener(s) as described in class
- Do not use float for layout
- Do not use tables or table-layouts
- Follow the best practices shared to date in this course
- Do not use `alert()` or `prompt()`
- Do not use outside CSS or JS or libraries unless explicitly permitted

## Grading Rubric
Note: The assignment is to show your understanding of the material from class.  If you don't do that, you can lose points, even it "it works".  Do NOT copy or generate your work (see "do-not-copy-work.md" at the root of this repo).

This assignment is graded on a number of categories, each graded on the below scale:
- Missing (0)
- Needs Improvement (1)
- Good (2)
- Excellent (3)

This means a single mistake might cost you 0 points or more than 1 point, depending on how much that mistake changes your demonstration of the skills from class.
