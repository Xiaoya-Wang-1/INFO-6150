# Course Syllabus: INFO 6150 - Seattle
# Fall Semester 2024 - Fri
Instructor: Brett Ritter `<b.ritter@neu.edu>`

This course covers the essentials of front-end web development in terms of User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX).  This will NOT teach you to be a designer, but will give you the building blocks to work with designers or decide you want to learn more about Human/Computer Interaction (HCI).  It will also not teach you all the steps to perform full web development (see my INFO6250 for that) but will give you the basis to be effective at UI/UX design and implementation for web development.

Some of what we cover
- Basic git use as a version control system for shared applications and development
- How a web page is rendered in the browser
- Fundamental HTML and CSS
- Semantic HTML (using HTML5)
- Different approaches to styling with CSS, their pros and cons
- Mobile-first
- Responsive and adaptive design
- Basic accessibility (a11y) concerns
- Common UI patterns and their impact on UX
- Introductory JavaScript (JS) to create interactions
- Introductory React 

### What is NOT covered
- In-depth JavaScript (JS)
  - We cover introductory Javascript and use it to create certain interactions.  More advanced topics like web service calls (AJAX) are not covered in this course.
- Backend coding
  - Backend web development is done in various languages and platforms to generate the front end code we learn in this course and/or to create web services to provide data to front end Javascript.  To learn more about backend web development see my INFO 6250 course.
- Specific Libraries - The course covers fundamentals to allow you to evaluate and use multiple libraries, but does not cover using specific libraries outside of Vite and React
- SQL/NoSQL usage or database architectures/maintenance

## Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend the weekly class sessions (in-person in the classroom) and ask questions whenever the lectures are unclear to them.  Barring emergencies, any absences must be requested and approved in advance.  Students registered in MGEN courses (INFO, CSYE, and DAMG) are allowed a maximum of 2 absences per course, with 3 or more absences resulting in an automatic 'F' for that course. Students are expected to inform their instructors of any absences in advance of the class; if a student is sick long-term or experiences a medical issue that prevents class attendance, it is strongly encouraged that they speak with their Academic Advisor (coe-mgen-gradadvising@northeastern.edu) to learn more about the Medical Leave of Absence. Should a student anticipate being unable to attend 3 or more classes, they should discuss their situation with their Academic Advisor to explore other types of leave in accordance with the University's academic and global entry expectations. International students should review the Office of Global Services webpage to understand their visa compliance requirements.

Teaching Assistants (TAs) or Instructional Assistants (IAs) will be present at each class to collect student attendance.

## Late Work Policy

- Students are expected to complete the weekly assignments between classes and submit to their class Github repositories by the deadline (normally before the day of the next class)
- Students are expected to complete the weekly Canvas-based quizzes between classes and submit online before the deadline (normally before the day of the next class)
- Students are expected to complete the course projects between classes and submit to their class Github repositories by the deadline (normally before the day of the next class)

Students must communicate with the faculty prior to the deadline if they anticipate work will be submitted late. Work submitted late without prior communication with faculty will not be graded. Late work submitted WITH prior communication is either granted an extension (no grade penalty) OR will be graded with a penalty and only graded after on-time assignments are graded, time-permitting.  Any submission that was not granted an extension has no guarantee that it will be graded.  

## End-of-Course Evaluation Surveys 
Your feedback regarding your educational experience in this class is particularly important to the College of Professional Studies. Your comments will make a difference in the future planning and presentation of our curriculum.

I, as the instructor, value all feedback and use it to shape further improvements in the course.

At the end of this course, please take the time to complete the evaluation survey at https://neu.evaluationkit.com. Your survey responses are completely anonymous and confidential. For courses 6 weeks in length or shorter, surveys will be open one week prior to the end of the courses; for courses greater than 6 weeks in length, surveys will be open for two weeks. An email will be sent to your Husky Mail account notifying you when surveys are available.

## Academic Integrity 
A commitment to the principles of academic integrity is essential to the mission of Northeastern University. The promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and undermines the achievements of the entire University.

As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and responsibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Students are responsible for learning the conventions of documentation and acknowledgment of sources in their fields. Northeastern University expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to the highest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implicitly in this Code or by the direction of instructors.
